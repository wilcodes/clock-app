# clock-appðŸ•“
## Good looking clock web application inspired by Frontend Mentor 
### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- I used Three API to access the data required in the App
- For the Worldtime data I used [worldTimeAPI](https://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip)
- For the Location data I used [geolocationAPI](https://freegeoip.app/json/)
- For the Quote data I used [quoteAPI](https://api.quotable.io/random)

- I got to work with a custome hook to manage all the APIs.
- In addition to that, the interface changes Based on the time of the day going from a day to a night mood.
